# Purpose: Calculate minimum and maximum lengths of reference ILP prepropeptides for filtering
# Inputs: input/ref_ILPs.fasta (annotated ILP/non-ILP sequences)
# Output: preprocess/ref_lengths.txt (min and max lengths as two lines)
# Notes: Used to set dynamic length thresholds in preprocessing step
